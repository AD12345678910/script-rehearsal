You can roll it along the table just like a real ball. But you can't force it to unwind, the more you force it the more frightened it gets and the tighter it stays rolled up. They like to eat live food, of course, but you can feed them in captivity on raw beef if you cover it with chicken feathers or rabbit fur."
